# Blockopolis
A Minecraft clone made with Unity, as a hobby project.

I am currently not accepting commits from people,
if you have any questions add me on discord (spectralmage12).

# Requirements
- Unity 2022.3.9f
- Some C# and Unity knowledge

# Installation
- Clone the project using git
- Open it with Unity 2022.3.9f
- Open the Package Maneger window

# Something went wrong?
If something went wrong, like the world not loading after exporting,
try going to Assets > Reimport All (and then restarting Unity)
