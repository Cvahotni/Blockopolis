# Blockopolis
A Minecraft clone made with Unity, as a hobby project.

I am currently not accepting commits from people,
if you have any questions add me on discord (spectralmage12).

# Requirements
- Unity 2022.3.9f
- Some C# and Unity knowledge

# Installation
- Clone the project using git
- Open it with Unity 2023.1.7f
- Open the Package Maneger window
- Install the packages: Burst, Collections, Mathematics, Universal RP, and Text Mesh Pro

# Something went wrong?
Fix 1:
If something went wrong, like the world not loading after exporting,
try going to Assets > Reimport All (and then restarting Unity)

Fix 2:
If there are errors relating to meta data files, close Unity, then delete the
"Library" folder. Then open the Unity project again, this should force Unity
to regenerate all the meta data files.
